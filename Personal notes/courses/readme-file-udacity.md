.md is an extension for Markdwon which is light markup language used for READMEs. It has multiple "dialects" if you'd use it on Github - check the docu at: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github

Quick simple and common uses:
- for bold use -> **word**
- for italic use -> _word_
- for adding code use -> `code_word` 
- for headers use -> # header1 , ## header2 ...etc.

**Component:** a visual representation of a small piece of content. They should usually be dumb and flexible, without an influence on their with, background or external margins and padding. The benefit of this would be that when using those components in a layout, let's say three-column based, they'd all line up perfectly (because no component has a top margin).

**Component modifier (skin or subcomponent):** this term could differ depending on the used methodology, but refers to the class that are assinged to allow having multiple variations of a component so it can be used in different circumstances.

**Fluid grids:** percentage based width rather than fixed-pixel dimensions

**Flexible images:** 100% width images fill the container they are put in and flex as the view port changes size

**Media queries:** Being able to specify different styles for different view port sizes, now we can change the page layout based on the size of the screen.
Div soup: when many divs are nested in on top of each other to achieve a special layout for a simple content at the center of those divs (this is comes from procedural markup)

**Task Runner:** in the context of node.js, a task runner is a tool that automate reptitive tasks invovled in the development workflow such as: running tests or specific commands, minifying CSS or deploying code to servers, and many others.
There're multiple tasks runners like Gulp, Grunt and npm scripts (even though not a task runner per say).
Example: for npm scripts, the details are stored the package.json file:
```
{
  "scripts": {
    "watch": "npm-run-all --parallel watch:sass watch:scripts",
    "build": "npm run sass && npm run scripts",
  }
}
```
Then you can use npm build to run the task as specified above.

**Unit testing:** the process of breaking down the application code to the smallest possible functions and creating repeatable, automated tests that continually produce the same result.

**Atomic Design:** is an approach in which design focuses on the smallest element that can be used to create a front-end representation (atom) instead of starting by whole web page designing. Usually the different atoms can be combined together to create molecules which are usually a set of atoms which represent something meaningful on the user interface like a search form (title as an atom + fields as atom + submit button as an atom ..etc). Organism is the next building block which contains multiple molecules like a blog post section on a website. Afterwards come templates which are the combination of different organisms including headers and footers.

**Software Architecture:** â€œa set of artifacts (that is principles, guidelines, policies, models, standards and processes) and the relationships between these artifacts, that guide the selection, creation and implementation of solutions aligned with business goals. Software architecture is the structure of structures of an information system of entities and their externally visible properties, and the relationships among them. (Dr. Jean-Claude Franchitti)

**Web Framework** it's a collection of tools, high level interfaces and and features to improve the developer experience.

**Command Line Interface** a mechansim that allows you to interact with your comptuer's OS via written commands via keyboard..

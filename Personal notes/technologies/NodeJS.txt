NodeJS is a free and open source JS execution / runtime env  (particularly on the server / outside the browser).
Its applications run in a singple process which enables async and event-driven I/O which suited for fast web apps.
It can hnadle bulk operations (like interactions with DB and networks) with a server without multi-threading.

Main features:
- Non-blocking model that handles operations async
- Modularity (code sharing in large scale apps)
- Built-in debugging tools and console.log() support for troubleshooting

NodeJS is a free and open source JS execution / runtime env  (particularly on the server / outside the browser).
Its applications run in a singple process which enables async and event-driven I/O which suited for fast web apps.
It can hnadle bulk operations (like interactions with DB and networks) with a server without multi-threading.
NodeJS could be suitable for many use cases and has a broader landscape compared to other frameworks like NextJS which is mainly focused on web applications as NodeJS can be useful in IoT, data analytics fields as well.



Main features:
- Non-blocking model that handles operations async
- Modularity (code sharing in large scale apps)
- Built-in debugging tools and console.log() support for troubleshooting

Setup:
Takes a bit of time and requires a considerable amount of config files at the root directory.

Routing:
- Using a framework, like Express provides the necessary objects and methods to perform routing.
- Without a framework requires a server setup by the development team for which the HTTP module could be used.

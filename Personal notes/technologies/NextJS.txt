Next.js is a free and open source react-based framework which supports static and server-rendered pages which help to build dynamic and hybrid applications.
It builds on top of React.js to provide additional services, features and tools (bundling, compiling, fetching data, routing and TypeScript ..etc.)

It can run:
#1 Server-side rendering which entails dynamic generation where the server renders the React application generating the HTML
#2 Static site generation in which it pre-renders the site by copying files into CDN which increases the speed of the site.
#3 Static incremental rendering in which statid and dynamic properties are comgined allowing generation of static content but at the time providing possiblity to updaing certain elements before the generation.

It supports:
#1 Using TypeScript
#2 File-based router supporting layouts, nested routing and error handling
#3 Styling via CSS modules, tailwind or CSS-in-JS
#4 Data Fetching through async/await in server components.
#5 Optimizations for images, fonts and scripts.

Elm: https://elm-lang.org/
Elm is a programming language that was focused on providing reliable web application by specifically eliminating the occurrences of run time exceptions.
The compiler will do comprehensive evaluation and provides feedback & messages during the build in order block going live with any possible error (apart from logical errors).


The architecture of Elm: https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/
It basically based on spitting out HTML and accepting messages.
It has 3 main core components:
- Model: state of the application
- View: a way to turn state into HTML
- Update: a way to update things based on the messages

Elm promises simplicity and better web performance.
